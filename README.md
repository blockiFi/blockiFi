Hello! I'm Sam, a certified full stack DeFi developer,

Technology I like to use:

Laravel (PHP)
VUE JS
MYSQL


Hardhat, Truffle, Ganache, OpenZeppelin

I am a fan of both the Hardhat and Truffle suites For the development of Smart Contracts / DApps. Each has some advantages: Hardhat is easy to use and you can fork chains quickly; Truffle has an elegant UI and some friendly debugging tools. I won't pick either side in this debate.

I believe in standing on the shoulders of giants. In this case, OpenZeppelin's smart contract templates and interfaces. Well tested and secure, so they are my go-to to start a project.

 Mocha, Jest, PyTest
 The first thing I will do in a project is set up automated testing. 
 Testing becomes even more critical when you consider that you can't update a smart contract after deployment.
 Better get it right. Every check in to GitHub results in the entire test suite being run on the codebase.
 
 About Me:
 
 I have over 5 years of development experience. 
 I am passionate about DeFi, so much so that I have most of my own wealth in crypto.

Qualifications
